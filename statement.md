Project Statement: Flight Ticket Booking Program

This Python program simulates a simple flight ticket booking system that supports both domestic and international flights. It interacts with users through the console, prompting them to enter travel details such as starting point, destination, seat preference, trip type (one-way or round trip), and travel date.

The program contains two main functions: domestic() and international(). Depending on the user's initial input ("domestic" or "international"), the appropriate function is called.

domestic() function gathers input for domestic flights and then generates a random seat number and ticket price (within a specified INR range) for the booking.

international() function performs similar operations but generates a higher random ticket price reflecting international flight costs.

After collecting all inputs, the program prints a booking confirmation summary showing the route, date, seat number, seat type, price, and trip type.

Random values are used to simulate dynamic seat assignment and pricing, enhancing the realism of the booking system without requiring a database or real-time data.

Overall, this program demonstrates basic user input handling, conditional logic, function usage, and output formatting in Python, aimed at providing an interactive console-based flight booking experience.
